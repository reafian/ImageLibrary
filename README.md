**Image Library**

This is my pet project that I totally suck at. The idea is to create an searchable image library for album art. That way I don't have to keep trawling the web if I lose an image. The idea's there but the ability is lacking.

I'm thinking python backend and something like django or flask at the front. Given that I don't know either it doesn't really make a lot of difference...

*It's usually crap but if it works, it works :-)*

This is the stuff that's in this repo.

## Tools 

1. catalogue.sh - a small script to catalogue the iTunes / Music library and create a structure to hold the images. I could hold them in the database but I think I'll start 'simple' for the moment. The source needs to be the exported iTunes Library.xml file. Just set the apropriate variables at the top and the image structure should be created in the desired location.
